        <h2 class="naslov"> Baseball</h2>
     
        <p> Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. 
            The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player 
            on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to 
            hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance 
            counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive 
            team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance 
            around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and 
            touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). 
            The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.</p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="naslov"> Karate</h2>
       
        <p> 
            Karate, (Japanese: “empty hand”) unarmed martial-arts discipline employing kicking, striking, 
            and defensive blocking with arms and legs. Emphasis is on concentrating as much of the body’s
            power as possible at the point and instant of impact.In sporting karate and sparring (kumite) 
            in training, blows and kicks are stopped short, preferably within an inch of contact. Sporting 
            matches commonly last about three minutes, to a decision, if neither contestant has scored a 
            clean “killing” point in the estimation of the judges. Contests of form (kata) are also held, 
            in which single competitors perform predetermined series of movements simulating defense and 
            counterattack against several opponents. Performances are scored by a panel of judges, as in 
            gymnastics.

        <h2 class="naslov"> Skateboarding</h2>
        
        <p> Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and
            performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an 
            entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation.
            Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. </p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="naslov"> Sport climbing</h2>
       
        <p> Sport climbing is a form of rock climbing that may rely on permanent anchors fixed to the rock
            for protection, in which a rope that is attached to the climber is clipped into the anchors to 
            arrest a fall, or that involves climbing short distances with a crash pad underneath as protection. 
            This is in contrast to traditional climbing where climbers must place removable protection as they
            climb. Sport climbing usually involves lead climbing and toproping techniques, but free solo and 
            deep-water solo (no protection) climbing on sport routes is also sometimes possible.</p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="naslov"> Surfing</h2>
        
        <p> Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves toward the shore, especially by means of a surfboard.
            Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both 
            men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners.Early European explorers and
            travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to 
            the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of 
            both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the 
            end of the 19th century.
