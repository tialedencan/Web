    <h3>Tree Top History</h3>
        <div>
        <p class="textTreeTop">
            <br>
            With our headquarters in the heart of Washington’s apple country in Selah, WA, where our cooperative was
            founded, Tree Top remains committed to our co-op’s small town roots and rural values. Hardworking and 
            caring growers and employees are what make Tree Top special. Since 1960, we’ve been producing delicious 
            fruit products and ingredients.
        
            Over a half a century ago Bill Charbonneau, his wife and two sons moved to the Yakima Valley from southern
            California. He purchased a small apple processing plant on Produce Row in Selah, Washington, and set about
            developing a quality brand of apple juice. Once he perfected his clear, premium juice, Mr. Charbonneau 
            held a contest among his employees to choose a brand name for his product, and the winning entry was 
            “Tree Top.” It was widely believed in those days that the very best quality fruit grew at the top of the
            trees.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Charbonneau was a stickler about the quality and taste of his juice. His office was located within 
            the juicing facility so he could personally oversee its making. Apples were pressed and the juice stored 
            in 5,000 gallon holding tanks. Every time a batch of apples was pressed, a sample was brought to Mr. 
            Charbonneau to taste. If the juice did not meet his approval, the entire 5,000 gallon tank would be poured 
            down the drain.<br>
            <br>
            In 1960, a group of local apple growers decided to form a cooperative and purchase Mr. Charbonneau’s 
            company and the Tree Top brand to ensure they had a solid market for their apples. Mr. Charbonneau’s 
            discriminating quality standards are still prevalent in our culture and we’re just as picky about the 
            fruit products and ingredients we put our name on. Today, Tree Top maintains the only trained taste panel 
            in the apple juice industry.<br>

            <p class="textTreeTop">  While our expertise in fruit grew over the last half century as we learned how to turn fresh fruit into

            agricultural cooperative which provides profits to U.S. growers. Our grower’s orchards are scattered 
            throughout the fertile growing regions in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, however we now operate eight 
            facilities on the west coast close to where the fruit is harvested. These eight plants are capable of 
            producing world famous Tree Top brand juices and the widest range of processed fruit products of superior 
            quality.</p><br>

        <p class="apple">An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated 
            worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central 
            Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for 
            thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. 
            Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, 
            and European Christian tradition.

            Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of the parents, and the resultant fruit 
            frequently lack desired characteristics. Generally then, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal 
            grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be large and much slower 
            to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control speed of growth and the size of the resulting 
            tree allowing for easier harvesting.
            
            There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes 
            and use, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of 
            fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic 
            means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective 
            breeding in apple production.
            
            Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of 
            the total.</p>
