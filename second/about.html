                London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just over 9 million.
                It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, 
                and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was 
                founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.Since the 19th century, the name 
                "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, 
                Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which largely comprises Greater London, governed by the Greater London 
                Authority. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries held the national government 
                and parliament.
               
                As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce 
                and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and communications. Its GDP 
                (â‚¬801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the biggest urban economy in Europe, and it is one of the major financial centres 
                in the world. As of 2021, London had the most millionaires of any city. With Europe's largest concentration of higher 
                education institutions, it includes Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of 
                Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London. London has the busiest city airport 
                system in the world and the London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world. London is one of the
                most-visited cities in the world and is home to the most 5-star hotels of any city.
                
                London's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages. The mid-2018 population of Greater London of about 9 million
                made it Europe's third-most populous city, accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom[28] and over 
                16% of the population of England.Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, 
                Moscow and Paris, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.
