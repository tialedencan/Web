    <h1 class="title-sc">Who we are</h1>

    <p class="scenic-text">
        With a history dating back to 1938, Arriva has continuously adapted and evolved to become a leading 
        provider of passenger transport services with operations in 14 European countries.<br><br>
        
        We work with Governments, Passenger Transport Authorities and others to provide public transport 
        solutions that are safe, reliable and value for money.<br><br>
        
        We believe that public transport has many advantages over private car use in tackling congestion, 
        improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions.<br><br>
        
        We work with our partners to deliver public transport solutions that help to connect communities, 
        protect the environment and make a positive impact on society.<br><br>
        
        Our scale, extensive experience and understanding of what our customers want has helped us to become 
        one of the leading public transport operators in Europe.
