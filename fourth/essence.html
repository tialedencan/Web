    <p class="scenic-text">When one hears the words ‘Sri Lanka’, they think of golden beaches, sunsets, tea, or cricket teams. 
        Yet those who visit Sri Lanka come for the tropical sunsets but stay for the food.<br><br>

        Sri Lankan food is like no other. Filled with aromatic spices and vibrant colour, Sri Lankan food 
        leaves you feeling happy, warm, and content. To any native Sri Lankan, nothing beats a hearty plate
        of rice and curry. So much so that most Sri Lankans insist on carrying jars of homemade curry or 
        condiments when they travel abroad.<br><br>
        
        While spiciness is essentially a defining feature of Sri Lankan food, curry is most definitely another. 
        Various different curries made with a multitude of different vegetables, meats, and spices are abundant 
        in Sri Lanka. When you think of rice and curry, you immediately picture a full plate of rice, spicy meat 
        curry, dhal curry, papadum (crispy deep fried crackers), mallum (green salad) and a deep fried red chilli 
        for a little extra kick. Sri Lankan curry varies from the not-at-all-spicy kiri hodi and the mildly spicy 
        dhal curry to the eye-wateringly spicy chicken curry that is everyone’s favourite. From lunu miris (spicy 
        onion sambol) and pol sambol (coconut sambol) to maalu ambulthiyal (fish curry), the variety and variation 
        of Sri Lankan curry and sambols is endless, and is a must for everyone who visits Sri Lanka. But wait! Rice 
        is not the only thing you eat curry with! Sri Lankan cuisine offers a variety of uniquely Sri Lankan foods 
        such as indi appa (string hoppers), appa (hoppers), pittu and roti that pair amazingly well with the different
        curries and sambols.<br><br>
